# Acquiring household survey data

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

## Selection criteria and source of data

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

For developing countries, mostly 0fficial surveys used by the government
for monitoring poverty. Occasionally surveys are dropped due to quality
concerns with the survey design, welfare aggregate or auxilliary data.
Decision made by GPWG, reason summarized in What's New.

The data mostly come from household surveys, explain very briefly what a
household survey is, that NSOs conduct them. EU-SILC and LIS for some
countries, a subset of these based on admin data. Link to more country
information (country methodology pages).

## Representativeness

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Discuss within-country spatial coverage. Mention that non-national
surveys are also available but not used for regional/global numbers
(Argentina exception). Temporal coverage; often covers one year, \#\#
Binned vs. micro data [Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Mention countries exclusevely relying on binned data.

## How data are obtained

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Mostly receive data through country engagement, poverty economist,
processed and harmonized through GMD.

# Constructing welfare aggregates

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

## Income or consumption

[Marta]{style="color:red"}

Explain briefly each, advantages and disadvantages of each (PSPR 2018
annex has material on this). Explain how zero/negative incomes are
treated.

## Within-survey spatial/temporal delfation

[Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Explain that some countries use spatial/temporal deflation but not all.
Explain what spatial temporal deflation means. Mention
India/China/Indonesia. Explain decimal years and that for EU-SILC/LIS,
the reported year is the year before the survey year.

Poverty estimates are based on household welfare aggregates that are
constructed from income or consumption surveys. Consumption surveys are
often the source of data for most developing countries and are conducted
over a period of time, sometimes spanning two calendar years. The
Gambia, for example, has a survey or decimal year as 2015.31, meaning
that 69% of the months of the fieldwork fall in 2015 while 31% of the
fieldwork months fall in 2016. By convention, the year that is reported
is the floor of the decimal year (e.g. 2015 in the case of the Gambia
mentioned above). For EU-SILC/LIS countries, the reported year is the
year before the survey year.

Household welfare aggregates are adjusted for temporal and/or spatial
price differences within surveys, but not in all cases. Household
consumption expenditure could be converted into the prices of a
particular month or the average price level observed in a survey year
(e.g. with a consumer price index). Similarly, household consumption
expenditure could be converted into the prices of a particular location
(e.g. capital city) or the national average price level obtained from
both rural and urban prices (e.g. with a spatial price index). China,
India and Indonesia have rural/urban PPPs that are used to deflate
household welfare aggregates to account for spatial price differences
within these countries (more details in Section
\@ref(purchasing-power-parities-ppps). Sometimes, a spatio-temporal
price index is used to jointly adjust for both spatial and temporal
price differences (e.g. the household welfare aggregate from the survey
conducted in Ghana (2016.75) is evaluated at 2013 Greater Accra regional
prices). These temporal and/or spatial price adjustments are important
for constructing welfare aggregates in real terms.

## Questionnaire design

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Discuss the relevance of questionnaire design for the consumption
aggregate (perhaps refer to some of the papers on the topic). Use the
India MMRP/URP example (PSPR 2018 has material).

## Imputed rent

[Andres]{style="color:red"}

What it means to include it, when it is included. Use China/LAC examples
to show the relevance.

## Treatment of binned data

[Christoph and Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Let's put down the actual formulas we use here to convert binned data
into distributions.

In addition to micro data, grouped data are used as another source of
data for estimating poverty and inequality when micro data are not
available (e.g. China data). Grouped data are consumption expenditure or
income organized in graduated class intervals or bins (e.g. see [Table
1](https://rpubs.com/tsamuel/709173)). Grouped data can be used to
derive a Lorenz function that may be used to estimate poverty and
inequality measures. Two main approaches in the literature---the general
quadratic (GQ) Lorenz function and the Beta Lorenz function---tend to
estimate poverty and inequality fairly accurately [@datt1998]. Due to
its computational simplicity, the general quadratic (GQ) Lorenz function
is preferred. A parameterized GQ Lorenz function is estimated using the
following specification:

$$
L(1-L) = a(p^2-L) + bL(p-1) + c(p-L),
$$

where $p$ is the cumulative proportion of population, $L$ is the
cumulative proportion of consumption expenditure or income, and $a$,
$b$, $c$ are parameter estimates [@datt1998]. Poverty and inequality
measures are based on the parameter estimates (see Section
\@ref(calculating-poverty-and-inequality)).

## Equivalence scale

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Mention per capita assumptions, drawbacks of it, and why we are still
assuming it.

## Comparability database

[Andres]{style="color:red"}

Explain the comparaiblity database and link to it

# Generating survey estimates

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

## Consumer Price Indices (CPIs)

[Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Short paragraph summary of why CPIs are needed, which CPIs we use, and
link to the CPI paper

Consumer price indices (CPIs) summarize the prices of a representative
basket of good and services consumed by households within an economy
over a period of time. Inflation (deflation) occurs when there is a
positive (negative) change in the CPI between two time periods. With
inflation, the same amount of rupees is expected to buy more today than
in one year from today. CPIs are used to deflate nominal consumption
expenditure of households, so that the well-being of households can be
evaluated and compared between two time periods at constant prices.

The primary source of CPI data for PovcalNet updates is the IMF's
International Financial Statistics (IFS) monthly CPI series
[@lakner2018]. The simple average of the monthly CPI series for each
calender year is used as the annual CPI. When IFS data are missing,
other sources of CPI data are obtained from the World Economic Outlook
(WEO), National Statistical Offices (NSOs), and International Labor
Organization (ILO), among others. For more details on the different
sources of CPI data used for global poverty measurement, see Figure 1 of
@lakner2018 and "What's New" technical notes accompanying PovcalNet
updates (e.g. the latest [September 2020 PovcalNet Update: What's
New](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/september-2020-global-poverty-update-world-bank-new-annual-poverty-estimates-using-revised)).

CPI series are expressed in the prices of the ICP reference year,
currently 2011.

## Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)

[Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Short paragraph summary of why PPPs are needed, which PPPs we use and
link to the PPP paper

Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are used in global poverty estimation
to adjust for relative price differences across countries. PPPs are
price indices that measure how much it costs to purchase a basket of
goods and services in one country compared to how much it costs to
purchase the same basket of goods and services in a reference country,
typically the United States. PPP exchange rates are preferred to market
exchange rates for the measurement of global poverty because the latter
overestimates poverty in developing countries, where non-tradable
services are relatively cheap (i.e., the Balassa-Samuelson-Penn effect).
The revised 2011 PPPs are currently used to convert household
consumption or income aggregates, originally expressed in local currency
units, into a common internationally comparable currency unit.

The PPP estimates published by the ICP are used for global poverty
measurement. A few special cases are described in the following. PPPs
are imputed for six countries, namely Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lao, Myanmar
and Yemen, where there are concerns over the coverage and/or quality of
the underlying ICP price collection [@atamanov2018; @atamanov2020]. To
account for "urban bias" in ICP data collection, rural-urban PPPs are
also imputed for China, India and Indonesia using official national
PPPs, the ratio of urban to rural poverty line, and the urban share in
ICP price data collection [@chen2008; @chen2010; @jolliffe2015a;
@ferreira2016].

## Derivation of the international poverty line

[Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Explain in one paragraph or so how the international poverty line was
derived and link to the RCS and Ferreira et al. paper

The international poverty line (IPL) summarizes and converts into
PPP-adjusted dollars the national poverty lines of a reference group of
poorest countries in the world. Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (2009)
selected 15 poorest countries based on household final consumption
expenditure per capita of countries around 2008 when the 2005 PPPs were
released. The 15 poorest countries at the time were Ethiopia, Ghana, The
Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mozambique, Malawi, Niger, Nepal, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, Chad, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. An IPL of
\$1.25/day per person, expressed in 2005 PPP dollars, was determined as
the mean of the national poverty lines of these countries. When the 2011
PPPs were released in 2014, the same 15 national poverty lines were
used, but now converted to 2011 PPPs yielding an IPL of \$1.88, which
was rounded to \$1.90 [@ferreira2015g;@ferreira2016]. When the 2011 PPPs
got revised in 2020, the IPL was similarly updated but remains unchanged
at \$1.90 [@atamanov2020; @worldbank2020].

## Derivation of other global poverty lines

[Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Explain how higher lines are derived and link to Jolliffe & Prydz paper

In addition to the IPL, the World Bank uses two higher poverty lines to
measure and monitor poverty in countries with a low incidence of
poverty. These higher lines, namely \$3.20 and \$5.50 in revised 2011
PPPs, correspond to the national poverty lines of countries the World
Bank classifies as lower- and upper-middle income countries,
respectively. @jolliffe2016 used "implicit national poverty lines" to
derive global poverty lines, including the IPL and higher lines.
Implicit national poverty lines are defined as the percentiles that
correspond to the national poverty rates that countries report,
regardless of differences in methodology. Implicit national poverty
lines are retrieved from
[PovcalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/home.aspx), which
contains all the Word Bank's consumption expenditure and income
distributions denominated in 2011 PPP dollars per capita. @jolliffe2016
suggested a robust IPL estimate of \$1.90 as the median of national
implicit poverty lines for low income countries from their approach.
They further proposed, as higher global poverty lines, \$3.20 and \$5.50
as the median values of implicit poverty lines corresponding to lower-
and upper-middle income countries, respectively. These lines were
originally defined in original 2011 PPPs, but have later been updated
using the revised 2011 PPPs with virtually no changes observed
[@jolliffe2016;@atamanov2020;@worldbank2020].

# Calculating poverty and inequality {#sec:title}

[Daniel]{style="color:red"}

Poverty and inequality measures estimated from micro data are mainly
based on formulae in @haughton2009, while poverty and inequality
measures estimated from grouped data are mainly based on formulae in
@datt1998.

## FGT measures

[Aleksander and Samuel]{style="color:red"}

In this subsectoin and the one below, let's write the name of each
measure in Povcalnet and provide formulas for how they are derived. The
FGT formulas should be easily available online

**Poverty headcount index**: The poverty headcount index ($P_0$) is a
measure of the proportion of the population that is counted as poor. The
poverty headcount index is obtained from micro data with the following
expression:$$ P_0 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} I (y_i < z), $$

where $N$ is the total population size, $y_i$ is consumption expenditure
or income of individual $i$, $z$ is the poverty line, and $I(.)$ is an
indicator function that takes on the value 1 if the bracketed expression
is true or 0 otherwise.

Headcount:
<https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_poverty_stats.R>

For grouped data, the poverty headcount is obtained using the following
expression:

$$
P_0 = - \frac{1}{2m}[n + r(b+2z/\mu)((b+2z/\mu)^2)-m)^{-1/2}],
$$

where $m$ = $b^2 - 4a$, $n = 2be - 4c$, $r = (n^2 - 4me^2)^{1/2}$,
$e = -(a + b + c + 1)$, $z$ is the poverty line, $\mu$ is the mean
consumption expenditure or income, and $a, b, c$ are the parameter
estimates of the GQ Lorenz function.

**Poverty gap index**: The poverty gap index ($P_1$) is a measure that
adds up the extent to which individuals on average fall below the
poverty line, and expresses it as a percentage of the poverty line. The
poverty gap index is obtained from micro data with the following
expression:

$$ P_1 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{G_i}{z} $$ with
$G_i = (z - y_i) × I (y_i < z)$, where $G_i$ is defined as the poverty
gap (i.e. poverty line ($z$) less consumption expenditure or income
($y_i$)) of poor individuals; the gap is considered to be zero for
everyone else. The poverty gap index shows the average minimum cost of
eliminating poverty (relative to the poverty line) using targeted
transfers, expressed as a percentage of the poverty line (source code:
[micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_poverty_stats.R)).

For grouped data, the poverty gap index is obtained using the following
expression:

$$
P_1 = P_0 - (\mu/z)L(P_0)
$$

with all variables defined as before (source code: [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).

**Poverty severity index**: The poverty severity index ($P_2$) is a
measure of the weighted sum of poverty gaps (as a proportion of the
poverty line), where the weights are the proportionate poverty gaps
themselves. The poverty severity index is obtained from micro data with
the following expression:

$$ P_1 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{G_i}{z} \right)^2 $$

with all variables defined as before. Also known as the poverty squared
gap index, the poverty severity index accounts for inequality among the
poor (source code: [micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_poverty_stats.R)).

For grouped data, the poverty severity index is obtained using the
following expression:

$$
P_2 = 2(P_1) - P_0 - \left(\frac{\mu}{z}\right)^2 \left[aP_0 + bL(P_0) - \left(\frac{r}{16}\right)ln \left(\frac{1 - P_0/s_1}{1 - P_0/s_2}\right)     \right],
$$

where $s_1 = (r- n)/(2m)$, $s_2 = -(r + n)/(2m)$, and all other
variables are defined as before (source code: [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).

**The Watts index**: The Watts index ($W$) is also an
inequality-sensitive poverty measure that is given as:

$$ W  = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{q} ln \left(\frac{z}{y_i} \right), $$

where $N$ individuals in the population are indexed in ascending order
of consumption expenditure (or income), and the sum is taken over $q$
individuals whose consumption expenditure or income $y_i$ falls below
the poverty line $z$. This formula applies for both micro and grouped
data (source code: [micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_poverty_stats.R)
and [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).

## Inequality measures

[Aleksander and Samuel]{style="color:red"}

Can we get to the source code find out how the various other measures
are calculated and list it here?

**Gini coefficient**: The Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz
curve, which plots cumulative consumption expenditure (or income) share
(on the y-axis) against cumulative population share (on the x-axis). A
45-degree line is defined over the Lorenz curve as a line of perfect
equality. The Gini coefficient is the area between the line 45-degree
line and the Lorenz curve. Let $A$ be the area between the 45-degree
line and the Lorenz curve, and let $B$ be the area under the Lorenz
curve. The Gini coefficient ($Gini$) is given as: $\frac{A}{A + B}= 2A$
(since $A + B = 0.5$).

Formally, if $x_i$ is a point on the x-axis, and $y_i$ a point on the
y-axis, then

$$ Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - x_{i-1})(y_i + y_{i-1}).
$$

When there are $N$ equal intervals on the x-axis, the equation above
simplifies to:

$$ Gini = 1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i + y_{i-1}). $$

The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete
inequality) (source code: [micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_gini.R)).

For grouped data, the Gini coefficient is obtained using the following
expression
<!--# would be nice to have this in one conditional equation with one curly bracket to the left, for example -->:

$$
Gini = \frac{e}{2} - \frac{n(b + 2)}{4m} + \frac{r^2}{8m\sqrt{-m}} \left[\sin^{-1} \frac{(2m + n)}{r} - \sin^{-1}\frac{n}{r} \right] \text{if $m<0$}
$$

$$
Gini = \frac{e}{2} - \frac{n(b + 2)}{4m} + \frac{r^2}{8m\sqrt{m}} ln\left[\text{abs}\left( \frac{2m + n + 2\sqrt{m}(a + c - 1)}{n - 2e\sqrt{m}}\right) \right] \text{if $m>0$}
$$

with all variables defined as before (source code: [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).

**Mean log deviation**: The mean log deviation (MLD) belongs to the
family of generalized entropy (GE) inequality measures. It is given as:

$$ MLD  = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} ln \left(\frac{\bar{y}}{y_i} \right), $$

where $N$ is the total population size, $\bar{y}$ is the mean
consumption expenditure or income per person, and $y_i$ is consumption
expenditure or income of individual $i$. The mean log deviation has a
minimum value of 0 (perfect equality) and has no upper bound. This
formula applies for both micro and grouped data (source code: [micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_mld.R)
and [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).

**Polarization**: The polarization index ($P$) measures the extent to
which the distribution of consumption expenditure or income is "spread
out" and bi-modal. It is given as:

$$
P =  \frac{2(\mu^* - \mu^L)}{m},
$$

where $\mu^*$ is the distribution-correction mean (i.e.
$\mu(1 - Gini)$), $\mu^L$ is the mean of the poorest half of the
population, and $m$ is the median. Like the Gini coefficient, the
polarization index ranges from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (complete
polarization). The polarization index is based on @wolfson1994 and
@ravallion1996. This formula applies for both micro and grouped data
(source code: [micro
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/md_compute_polarization.R)
and [grouped
data](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/wbpip/blob/master/R/gd_compute_pip_stats_lq.R)).
